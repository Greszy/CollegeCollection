# Collection of college assignments 

In this repository I am collecting all my assignments that I have completed during my time at Baruch College. All of the projects included are related either to some tehnology or business subject, sometimes both. Under each directory you can find reports, descriptions and/or slides describing work that I often in collaboration with team members had to do to complete an assignment. Since certain projects have been done a while ago, I have lost some of the resources associated with them. I am in the process of retrieving as much documentation and scripts as possible. Even though some documents might be missing every folder includes some kind of document that provides what kind of project was it. Often the documentation provided was a big part of the project. Below I have provided brief description of each folder: 

# Project Descriptions

1. DataMining contains a paper that I wrote for my Data Mining for Business Analytics course. 

2. DataWarehouse contains a report how my team worked on setting up a data warehouse.

3. Excel_Finance presents some example Excel spreadsheets that I worked with during my accouting and business classes. 

4. IntroductoryDBMS contains my Access desktop database that I created for my Databases introductory course. 

5. ProjectManagement contains documentation for my Project Management class where I helped manage a team that worked on creating a web application.
